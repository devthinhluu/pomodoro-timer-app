# About

This is a simple tool that helps users increase their productivity by breaking down work into intervals (known as Pomodoros) separated by short breaks.

With this application, you can customize the length of your work and break intervals and track your progress as you complete Pomodoros. The timer will run in the background, allowing you to minimize the window and continue working on other tasks.

To get started, simply enter your desired work and break intervals and click the "Start" button. You can pause or reset the timer at any time.

I hope you find this application useful in helping you stay focused and increase your productivity. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to let me know!
